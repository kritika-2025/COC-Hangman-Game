## Simple Hangman (C)

This small project contains a simple terminal-based letter-guessing game (a basic Hangman) implemented in C.

Files
- `game.c` - the C source for the game. The secret word is hard-coded in the source.
- `output/` - (optional) a folder included in the workspace; you may place compiled binaries or logs here.

Description

`game.c` implements a minimal single-player hangman-style game:
- The secret word is stored in the `secret_word` array (currently set to `"DEBUGGERS"`).
- The player guesses one character at a time. Correct guesses reveal letters in the word; wrong guesses reduce the remaining lives.
- The player has 6 lives. The game ends when the word is fully revealed (win) or the lives run out (loss).

Important behavior notes
- Input is read with `scanf(" %c", &guess);` which expects a single character. Extra characters on the same line will not be consumed for subsequent reads.
- Letter matching is case-sensitive. The default secret word is uppercase (`DEBUGGERS`), so enter uppercase letters or change the `secret_word` in the source.
- There is minimal input validation — this is intentionally simple and meant for learning.

Prerequisites
- A C compiler (GCC / MinGW on Windows). The project was created with simple, standard C and requires no external libraries.

Build (Windows / PowerShell)

You can compile `game.c` with GCC (MinGW) from PowerShell:

```powershell
# If gcc is on PATH
gcc -g "game.c" -o "game.exe"

# Or specify the full path to MinGW's gcc if needed
"C:\\MinGW\\bin\\gcc.exe" -g "game.c" -o "game.exe"
```

If you use the VS Code C/C++ build task that was generated by the debugger, the task label is typically `C/C++: gcc.exe build active file` and will compile the active C file to an exe in the same folder.

Run

From PowerShell in the project directory:

```powershell
./game.exe
```

Gameplay
- The program will print the masked word (underscores for unknown letters) and the number of lives left.
- Type a single letter and press Enter to guess that letter.
- The program prints `Congratulations! You won!` when the word is fully revealed or `You lost! The word was: <WORD>` when lives reach zero.

Customization
- To change the secret word, edit `game.c` and modify the line:

```c
char secret_word[] = "DEBUGGERS";
```

Make sure to keep the secret word in quotes and use only alphabetic characters for best results.

Limitations and possible enhancements
- The game is case-sensitive and only accepts single-character guesses.
- It does not track or display previously guessed letters; repeated guesses of the same correct letter are ignored, while repeated wrong guesses will decrement lives again.
- Ideas for enhancement: case-insensitive input, word list file loading, drawing hangman ASCII art, tracking guessed letters, and improved input validation.
